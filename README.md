# Java-Practice
This repository contains my practice programs and exercises written in Java. It covers core concepts like variables, data types, loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, object-oriented programming (OOP), and more.  The purpose of this repo is to improve my understanding of Java fundamentals and to keep a record of my learning journey.
